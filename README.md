# From Nand to Tetris

Welcome to my personal deep dive into the legendary [_From Nand to Tetris_](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. This repository captures my progress, implementations, and reflections as I build a fully functioning computer system â€” from the ground up.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Included

This repo is structured to match the course's modular design:

- `projects/01`: Build basic logic gates using HDL (NAND, NOT, AND, OR, etc.)
- `projects/02`: Construct arithmetic and multiplexing circuits
- `projects/03`: Design sequential chips like registers and counters
- `projects/04`: Implement the Hack machineâ€™s architecture (ROM, CPU)
- `projects/05`: Develop the assembler to translate Hack assembly
- `projects/06`: Explore programming the Hack machine (assembly programs)
- `projects/07`: Build a virtual machine (VM translator)
- `projects/08`: Implement high-level OS components and abstractions
- `projects/09`: Write programs in Jack (high-level language)
- `projects/10`: Build a compiler from Jack to VM
- `projects/11`: Complete the operating system

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Setup

- **Hardware Simulator**: Provided in the Nand2Tetris tool suite
- **Assembler & VM Translator**: Implemented in Python
- **Compiler**: Written in Java/Python (language choice noted per section)
- **Tests**: Provided via `.tst` and `.cmp` files; plus custom unit tests

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Goals

- Understand computation from logic gates to operating systems
- Master HDL syntax and low-level architecture
- Implement a compiler, assembler, and virtual machine
- Explore programming language design and OS abstractions

## ðŸŽ¯ Progress & Reflections

Youâ€™ll find write-ups and notes in each subfolder detailing:
- Design decisions
- Test results
- Challenges & fixes
- Code explanations
